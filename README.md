# SolScope (Android)

SolScope is a native Android application that analyzes Solana wallet activity and generates a conservative, explainable risk score to help users understand potential exposure before interacting with unknown tokens or programs.

## Problem

Everyday Solana users frequently interact with new tokens and programs without visibility into potential behavioral risk signals.

## Solution

SolScope evaluates wallet activity patterns using a rule-based risk engine and presents a clear, explainable safety score.

## Architecture (Planned)

- Native Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- Direct Solana RPC integration
- Conservative rule-based risk engine
- Explainable insights (Basic / Advanced view)
- Devnet / Mainnet toggle

## Status

In active development.
